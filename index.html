        <h3>So, what's your deal?</h3>
        <p>
          In the world today it's all the rage to think that the way forward&mdash;politically speaking&mdash;is to elect people to high office who we feel have been "untainted" by the nasty business of politics. Politicians, the conventional wisdom goes, are all just monstrous liars bent on nothing but their own thirst for power and influence. They will do and say anything to get and stay elected, no matter who they hurt in the process.

        <blockquote>I have an equally serious problem with our (almost willing) inability to separate news from entertainment, which aids and abbets our poor choices during elections.</blockquote>
        <p>
          So (to continue the thread of the current wisdom), we should elect people who "say what they mean", and "speak their minds"; people who "don't mince words" or "will fight for the little guy". People without political knowledge, or people with extensive knowledge of business or showbiz, can just apply those same skills to being president or governor, and everything will Just Get Better&trade;.
        </p>
        <h3>That sounds great. I love straight talkers!</h3>
        <p>
          Frankly, in the United States anyway, our record of doing this to good effect is for shit. One of the best known examples of this fallacious idea is Ronald Reagan, whose presidency is both revered by Republicans as a runaway P.R. success and condemned by people who aren't mentally unwell as a towering failure for the <a href="http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1984030900">poor and working class who elected him</a>. Other examples include Sonny Bono, who helped sign the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act">Copyright Extension Act of 1998</a>, which was a gift to large corporations and helped set the stage for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act">Digital Millenium Copyright Act</a>, which has also been used to <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/unintended-consequences-16-years-under-dmca">bully the public and stifle innovation for any but the richest corporations</a>. And then there's Donald Trump&mdash;who will be <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rls=en&q=mueller+investigation+latest+news&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">very lucky if he makes it out of his first term without being indicted for a list of crimes including collusion with a foreign government</a>. None of these people did anything for the people who championed them, on balance. They simply rode populist movements to power.

        <h3>You got some axe to grind with Oprah?</h3>
        <p>
          I don't dislike Oprah Winfrey particularly. She certainly has an ability to get large groups of humans pointed in the same direction (usually in the direction of some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Million_Little_Pieces">schlocky book</a> or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/12/19/half-of-dr-ozs-medical-advice-is-baseless-or-wrong-study-says/?utm_term=.4869dc1284c7">weird fraudulent health craze</a>, but that's beside the point <em>sort of</em>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          My issue is not with her, but with our national inability to learn anything about cults of personality and how they work. I have a serious problem with our lack of desire to vet candidates with proper credentials, or to want to do the hard work of being part of an electorate. I have an equally serious problem with our (almost willing) inability to <a href="http://www.medialit.org/reading-room/whatever-happened-news">separate news from entertainment</a>, which aids and abbets our poor choices during elections. The sad fact is that not everything should (or even can) be as easy as Tinder, Facebook or Snapchat. Sitting in front of Fox News twenty-four hours a day doesn't prepare you for life any better than watching the Daily Show does. Being an informed voter is hard, and people like Mark Zuckerberg (who also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/15/mark-zuckerberg-could-be-running-for-president-in-2020.html">wants to be celebrity in chief</a>) are only making it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/us/politics/russia-technology-facebook.html">more difficult</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Are people allowed to change careers, or apply skills from one walk of life in another? Sure. It's not impossible for a celebrity to become a contributing leader with things to say and the skills to match. But we have a farm team for people like that. Before you sign up to get the nuclear launch codes, why not run the school board or be in your state assembly?
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm sure Ms. Winfrey has many fine qualities&mdash;but these aren't all you need. I can draw pretty well. That doesn't mean I should help to design the bridges you use to commute every day. Governance requires skills other than human persuasion. There are also <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/michelleobama/">plenty</a> of much more <a href="https://www.elizabethwarren.com/stop-trump">qualified</a> <a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/">women</a> out there to nominate</strong>, if that's what you want to do (and you should).
        </p>
